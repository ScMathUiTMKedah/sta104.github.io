7. Sampling techniques  

  a. Probability Sampling  
      - Simple random sampling (SRS)  
      - Systematic sampling  
      - Stratified sampling  
      - Cluster sampling  
      - Multistage sampling  
      
  b. Nonprobability Sampling  
      - Convenience sampling  
      - Quota sampling  
      
8. Data Collection Methods  
  a. Interview (Face to face and telephone)  
  b. Direct Observation  
  c. Questionnaire ( self administered, electronic media)  
  d. Others

**Remark:**  
Define term of sampling unit and sampling frame.  
Emphasizing calculation on SRS, systematic and stratified sampling.  
Guidelines to construct the questionnaires.

**Topic 2: Describing Data**  
Data organization and presentation  

1. Graphical method for qualitative data  
      - Frequency Distribution Table  
      - Pie Chart  
      - Bar chart (Cluster, Stacked)  
      - Cross tabulation  
      
2. Graphical method for quantitative data  
      - Frequency Distribution Table  
      - Stem and Leaf  
      - Histogram  
      - Frequency Polygon  
      - Ogive  
      
3. Types of distribution

4. Numerical methods  

  a. Measure of central tendency for ungrouped and grouped  
      - Mean  
      - Median  
      - Mode  
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
\ 
<!-- an empty Div (with a whitespace), serving as

:::

::: {.column width="20%"}
**Remarks:**  

Using calculator to obtain sample mean and standard deviation. (Substitute all the summation values into the respective formula)  

Interpret result from calculation. 
(Emphasizing the interpretation on mean, median, mode, skewness and coefficient variation)

**Topic 3: Correlation and Regression**  

1. Correlation  
    - Define dependent and independent variable  
    - Scatter Plot  
    - Pearson’s correlation coefficient **(exclude Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient)**
