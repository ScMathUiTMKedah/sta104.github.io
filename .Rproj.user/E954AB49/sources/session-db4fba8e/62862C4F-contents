There is a **very** **strong negative** linear relationship between the typing speed of a secretary and the time that it takes the secretary to learn to use a new word processing program.\

\begin{aligned}
y &= a + bx\\

b &= \frac{{n(\sum xy) - (\sum x)(\sum y)}}{{n\sum x^2 - (\sum x)^2}}\\
&= \frac{12(3,163.8) - (884)(47.8)}{12(67,728) - 884^2}\\
&= −0.1371 \\

a &= \frac{\sum{y}}{n} - b\frac{\sum{x}}{n}\\
&= \frac{47.8}{12} - (-0.1371)\frac{884}{12}\\

e)\
For every 10 words increase in typing speed per minute, the time it takes a secretary to learn to use a new word processing program decreased by 1.371 hours.\
